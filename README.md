# leaf-disease-detection-and-cure-tips-recommendation

This project presents a smart and efficient Leaf Disease Detection and Cure Tips Recommendation System that leverages deep learning techniques to identify plant diseases from images of infected leaves. 
Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model + transfer learning trained on a dataset of over 30 plant disease categories, the system accurately classifies diseased leaves and provides relevant prevention or treatment suggestions.
